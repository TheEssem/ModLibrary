Mod Library
===========

Mod Library is a database for managing and searching your favourite music
modules. Thanks to libopenmpt, it supports a wealth of different module formats.

Dependencies
------------

Mod Library is written in C++ using Visual Studio 2010. It should also work on
various other compilers on operating systems other than Windows, but this is
currently untested.
Mod Library has the following external dependencies:

 -  Qt 5 (http://qt-project.org/)

 -  libopenmpt (http://lib.openmpt.org/) - put this in the lib/libopenmpt folder

 -  PortAudio (http://portaudio.com/)
    The Visual Studio solution assumes this to be placed in the folder
    lib/libopempt/include/portaudio as the libopenmpt Windows package already
    comes with its own PortAudio package.
